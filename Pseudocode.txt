    b. Check if the selected column is valid (not full).
    c. Update the board with the player's piece in the chosen column.
    d. Check for a win condition horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    e. If a win condition is met, end the game and declare the winner.
    f. Switch to the next player.
5. If the board is full and no one wins, declare a draw.
